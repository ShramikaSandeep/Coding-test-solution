# Coding-test-solution
Coding challenge solution.

### Setup

    - Nodejs version 12+
    - Ability to connect to the internet

## Getting started

    - To install all dependencies run `npm install`
    - To run tests run `npm test`
    - To lint your js files `npm run lint:check`
    - To fix lint error in your js files run `npm run lint:fix`

## Instructions

    - The following files contain the source code providing the solution for each program:
        - `src/01_convert-object-to-array.js`
        - `src/02_get-first-non-repeating-char.js`
        - `src/03_pagination.js`
        - `src/04_remote-data.js`
    - The test files can be found alongside the solution file with `.spec.js` extension.
    - The fetch API from the following `https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch` is used to make API calls for `src/04_remote-data.js`.
    - EXTRA POINTS:
        - An extra test ( test 4) is added in `02_get-first-non-repeating-char.spec.js` to improve code coverage.

## End Goal

All tests pass!!
